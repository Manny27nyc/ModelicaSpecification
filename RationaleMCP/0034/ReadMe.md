# Modelica Change Proposal MCP-0034<br/>Ternary
Henrik Tidefelt

**(In Development)**

## Summary
It was concluded in [#2211](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/issues/2211) that an MCP for _Ternary_ (3-valued logic) in Modelica should be created, and here it is.

The proposal is based on the following principles:
- A new built-in type, `Ternary`.
- A new literal constant `unknown` for the third truth value.
- Explicit as well as implicit conversion from `Boolean`.
- No implicit conversion to `Boolean`.
- No new built-in functions.

See [design](ternary.md) for details.

## Rationale
See [separate document](rationale.md).

## Backwards Compatibility
The introduction of the keyword `unknown` introduces a backwards incompatibility with code making use of that name for identifiers.

## Tool Implementation
A prototype has been implemented in a development version of Wolfram SystemModeler.  In the prototype, the type is named `__Wolfram_Ternary`, and the third truth value is named `__Wolfram_unknown`.

### Experience with Prototype
Although introducing a new built-in type is a change that ammounts to a large number of smaller changes, finding the places in a code base that need attention is easy due to the similarity between `Ternary` and `Boolean`.  In a similar way, the implicit conversion from `Boolean` to `Ternary` is a feature that can be implemented by glancing at the handling of implicit conversion from `Integer` to `Real`.

Regarding the application of this MCP to a new attribute called `visible` in the `Dialog` annotation, the proposed choice of defining `not`, `and` and `or` in accordance with Kleene logic certainly gets the job done.  The default value of `unknown` which means _apply tool-specific rules for visibility_, a user can easily write a ternary logical expression to override the default in either way, and the expression may also evaluate to `unknown` in cases where the user doesn't want to fall back on the tool logic.  Thanks to the implicit cast from `Boolean`, most uses of `visible` would probably be in the simple forms `visible = true` or `visible = false`.  However, upon closer acquaintance with the Kleene logic – which still appears as the most natural basis for defining the logical connectives for `Ternary` – it has been questioned whether this is the best way to model the absence of information, see [rationale](rationale.md#The-option-type-alternative).

To the best of our knowledge, there are no patents that would conflict with the incorporation of this MCP.
